# Task ID: 43
# Title: Implement Email Notification System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 41
# Priority: low
# Description: Set up automated email notifications for important events using Resend API with React Email templates
# Details:
Create email notification system using existing Resend dependency and @react-email/render. Build email templates: upload completed (with summary), upload failed (with error details), weekly report (every Monday with stats). Implement notification triggers in upload API routes and create weekly cron job using Vercel Cron API routes. Create email templates directory with React Email components ensuring mobile-responsive design. Add opt-out functionality in settings page. Log failed emails for debugging. Use environment variables for Resend API key configuration.

# Test Strategy:
Test emails send successfully via Resend, verify templates are mobile-responsive, confirm users can opt-out in settings, test weekly report generation and sending, validate failed email logging works correctly

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set Up Resend API Integration and Environment Variables [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Integrate the Resend API for sending emails and securely configure API keys using environment variables.
### Details:
Install and configure the Resend API client in the backend. Store the API key in environment variables and ensure it is accessed securely in code. Validate the connection by sending a test email.

## 3. Implement Notification Triggers in API and Weekly Cron Job [done]
### Dependencies: 43.1, 43.2
### Description: Add logic to trigger email notifications in upload API routes and schedule weekly report emails using Vercel Cron API routes.
