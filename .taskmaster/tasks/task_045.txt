# Task ID: 45
# Title: Integration Testing and Quality Assurance
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44
# Priority: high
# Description: Comprehensive testing of all new features and existing functionality to ensure production readiness
# Details:
Create comprehensive test suite covering: unit tests for property status management, notifications API, statistics calculations; integration tests for email system, settings updates, dashboard functionality; end-to-end tests for critical user flows (upload → mark as sold → verify ministry endpoints). Test ministry compliance endpoints with various property statuses. Verify TypeScript compilation with 'npm run build'. Test responsive design on mobile/tablet/desktop. Perform security audit of RLS policies and API endpoints. Load test ministry endpoints. Create deployment checklist and verify Vercel deployment succeeds.

# Test Strategy:
All tests pass including unit, integration, and e2e tests. TypeScript compilation succeeds. Ministry endpoints return correct data excluding sold properties. Security audit passes. Load testing shows acceptable performance. Vercel deployment completes successfully.
