# Task ID: 67
# Title: Build Comprehensive Help Center and Documentation System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 57
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a /help page featuring a structured FAQ (20+ questions), video tutorials, API documentation for Enterprise users, and robust search functionality, following best practices for accessibility, maintainability, and user experience.
# Details:
1. **Page Structure & Routing**: Create a dedicated /help route with a responsive layout. Organize content into clear sections: FAQ, Video Tutorials, API Documentation, and Search. Use a sidebar or tabbed navigation for easy access to each section.

2. **FAQ Section**: Author at least 20 frequently asked questions based on support tickets, user feedback, and anticipated onboarding issues. Use a collapsible accordion UI for each question/answer pair. Structure content using pre-formatted templates (e.g., Introduction, Steps, Tips) for consistency[2][3]. Include cross-references to related articles or features where relevant.

3. **Video Tutorials**: Embed or host short, focused video guides covering key workflows (e.g., uploading CSV, setting up endpoints, verifying XML). Provide concise written summaries and step-by-step instructions alongside each video for accessibility. Ensure all videos have captions and descriptive alt text[1][3].

4. **API Documentation (Enterprise)**: Integrate interactive API documentation (e.g., Swagger UI or Redoc) for Enterprise endpoints. Clearly separate public and Enterprise-only documentation. Include code samples, authentication instructions, and example requests/responses. Keep documentation versioned and up-to-date with backend changes.

5. **Search Functionality**: Implement full-text search across all help content (FAQ, tutorials, API docs). Use a performant search library (e.g., Algolia, Fuse.js) with instant results and highlighting. Ensure search is accessible via keyboard and screen readers[2].

6. **Accessibility & Responsiveness**: Follow WCAG guidelines for color contrast, keyboard navigation, and semantic HTML. Ensure the help center is fully usable on mobile and desktop devices[1][2].

7. **Feedback & Analytics**: Allow users to rate articles or leave feedback. Collect analytics on search queries and article views to identify gaps and improve content iteratively[2][3].

8. **Collaboration & Maintenance**: Use a documentation tool or markdown-based system to enable team collaboration and version control. Establish a review process for technical accuracy and clarity before publishing. Schedule regular updates to keep documentation current with product changes[1][3].

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify /help page loads correctly and is accessible on all major browsers and devices.
2. Confirm FAQ section displays at least 20 well-structured questions with working expand/collapse and cross-references.
3. Test video tutorials for playback, captions, and accompanying text instructions; check accessibility compliance.
4. Validate API documentation renders correctly, is interactive, and matches backend endpoints; test code samples and authentication flows.
5. Ensure search returns relevant results from all help content, supports keyboard navigation, and highlights matches.
6. Use accessibility testing tools (e.g., axe, Lighthouse) to check for WCAG compliance.
7. Submit feedback/rating on articles and verify data is collected and visible in analytics.
8. Review documentation for clarity, accuracy, and up-to-date information with stakeholders before release.
