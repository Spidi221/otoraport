# Task ID: 63
# Title: Implement Advanced Analytics Dashboard for Enterprise
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 56
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a dedicated /dashboard/analytics page for Enterprise users featuring advanced charts (price trends, occupancy, days to sell), competitor benchmarking, and export options for PDF and Excel.
# Details:
1. **Requirements & Planning:**
   - Define dashboard goals and KPIs in collaboration with stakeholders (e.g., price trends, occupancy rates, days to sell, competitor benchmarks)[2][3][7].
   - Identify and integrate relevant data sources, including price history (from Task 56), property data, and competitor datasets.

2. **Data Preparation:**
   - Ensure data quality and consistency by cleaning and validating inputs from all sources[2][1].
   - Aggregate and preprocess data for efficient querying and visualization (consider caching or using dedicated analytics tables for heavy computations).

3. **Dashboard Design & UX:**
   - Design a clear, intuitive layout prioritizing key metrics and actionable insights above the fold[4][5].
   - Use interactive charts (e.g., line, bar, scatter) for price trends, occupancy, and days to sell, leveraging libraries such as Recharts or D3.js for advanced visuals.
   - Implement competitor benchmarking with comparative charts and tables.
   - Add filtering, sorting, and drill-down capabilities for deeper analysis[2][7].
   - Ensure mobile responsiveness and accessibility.

4. **Export Functionality:**
   - Integrate PDF export using libraries like jsPDF or Puppeteer, ensuring charts and tables render accurately.
   - Implement Excel export using libraries such as SheetJS, supporting both raw data and formatted tables.

5. **Security & Access Control:**
   - Restrict dashboard access to Enterprise users only, enforcing role-based access at both API and UI levels.
   - Ensure sensitive data is encrypted in transit and at rest, and comply with relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR)[1].

6. **Performance & Scalability:**
   - Optimize data queries and chart rendering for large datasets.
   - Monitor dashboard performance and schedule regular reviews for updates and improvements[1][2].

7. **Documentation & Training:**
   - Provide user documentation and onboarding materials for dashboard features and exports[1].

**Best Practices:**
- Focus on actionable insights and avoid cluttering the dashboard with unnecessary metrics[2][3][5].
- Use storytelling techniques to present data in a way that supports decision-making[3][7].
- Plan for iterative improvements based on user feedback and evolving business needs[2][1].

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify that only Enterprise users can access /dashboard/analytics and all data is scoped correctly.
2. Test each chart for accuracy, interactivity (filtering, sorting, drill-down), and correct rendering with sample and edge-case data.
3. Validate competitor benchmarking calculations and visualizations against known datasets.
4. Test PDF and Excel export features for completeness, formatting, and data integrity.
5. Perform performance testing with large datasets to ensure acceptable load times and responsiveness.
6. Conduct security audits for access control and data privacy compliance.
7. Review documentation and onboarding materials for clarity and completeness.
8. Gather user feedback and iterate on dashboard design and features.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and Implement Advanced Analytics Dashboard UI/UX [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the /dashboard/analytics page layout for Enterprise users, focusing on advanced charts (price trends, occupancy, days to sell), competitor benchmarking, and interactive features.
### Details:
Design a responsive dashboard using a clear hierarchy: place key metrics and actionable insights at the top left, group related charts into thematic sections, and ensure consistency in chart placement and labeling. Use interactive chart libraries (e.g., Recharts, D3.js) for advanced visuals, and implement filtering, sorting, and drill-down capabilities. Prioritize mobile responsiveness and accessibility throughout the design.

## 2. Integrate and Prepare Data for Analytics Visualizations [done]
### Dependencies: 63.1
### Description: Aggregate, clean, and preprocess data from price history, property, and competitor sources to support efficient querying and visualization in the dashboard.
### Details:
Connect to all required data sources, ensuring data quality and consistency through validation and cleaning routines. Aggregate and preprocess data for each metric (price trends, occupancy, days to sell, competitor benchmarks), considering caching or dedicated analytics tables for performance. Ensure data is scoped to Enterprise users and complies with privacy requirements.

## 3. Implement Export Functionality for PDF and Excel [done]
### Dependencies: 63.2
### Description: Enable exporting of dashboard charts and tables to PDF and Excel formats, ensuring accurate rendering and data formatting.
### Details:
Integrate PDF export using libraries like jsPDF or Puppeteer, ensuring all charts and tables render as expected. Implement Excel export with SheetJS, supporting both raw data and formatted tables. Ensure export features are accessible from the dashboard UI and maintain data privacy and access controls.
