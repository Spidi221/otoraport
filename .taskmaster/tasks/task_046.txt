2. Correct plan features - Basic (1 investment, 20 properties), Pro (2+ investments, unlimited properties, subdomains), Enterprise (unlimited everything, custom domains)
3. Add pricing calculator component for Pro plan showing additional investment costs (50zł each)

- Update feature lists to accurately reflect plan capabilities
- Create new PricingCalculator component for Pro plan additional investment cost calculation
- Update landing page text to reference correct pricing tiers
- Ensure responsive design maintains quality across all devices
- Update structured data/metadata if pricing is referenced

**Technical Considerations:**
- Use existing Radix UI components for consistency
- Maintain current responsive design patterns
- Ensure pricing calculator follows existing design system

# Test Strategy:
Verify pricing displays correctly across all screen sizes, test pricing calculator functionality (Pro plan additional investment calculations), confirm all plan features are accurately represented, validate FAQ section contains updated pricing, ensure structured data reflects correct pricing, test annual/monthly toggle works with new prices, verify CTA buttons link to correct signup flows with pricing parameters, test responsive design on mobile/tablet/desktop, confirm no old pricing information remains on the page, validate landing page loads quickly with new content.
