# Task ID: 64
# Title: Build Admin Panel - Property Management
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 39, 57
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the /admin/properties page for administrators, featuring cross-developer property search, advanced filters, bulk actions (approve, reject, delete), and CSV export functionality.
# Details:
1. **Page Structure & Access Control:**
   - Implement the /admin/properties route, restricting access to admin users only using existing authentication and role-based access control patterns.
   - Use a responsive, user-friendly UI framework (e.g., Radix UI, Material UI) to ensure intuitive navigation and accessibility across devices[4][2].

2. **Property Search & Filtering:**
   - Integrate a search bar supporting queries across all developers' properties (by address, property ID, or developer name).
   - Add advanced filters: developer (dropdown, multi-select), status (using enums from Task 39), price range (min/max), and location (city, region, or geospatial input).
   - Ensure filters are debounced and server-driven for scalability with large datasets.

3. **Properties Table:**
   - Display properties in a paginated, sortable table with columns: Property ID, Developer, Status (with StatusBadge from Task 39), Price, Location, and Actions.
   - Support multi-row selection with checkboxes for bulk actions.

4. **Bulk Actions:**
   - Implement toolbar for bulk approve, reject, and delete actions.
   - Use confirmation dialogs for destructive actions (reject, delete) and optimistic UI updates with error handling.
   - Integrate with existing PATCH /api/properties/bulk endpoint for status updates (from Task 39); create new endpoints if needed for approve/reject/delete.

5. **CSV Export:**
   - Add export button to download filtered property data as CSV.
   - Ensure exported data respects current filters and includes all visible columns.
   - Use streaming or background job for large exports to avoid blocking UI.

6. **Performance & Security:**
   - Use server-side pagination and filtering to handle large property datasets efficiently.
   - Enforce strict RLS policies to prevent unauthorized data access, even for admin users.
   - Log all bulk actions for auditability.

7. **UI/UX Best Practices:**
   - Provide loading and empty states, error feedback, and accessible keyboard navigation.
   - Ensure all actions are undoable where feasible (e.g., soft delete with restore option).
   - Follow consistent design patterns with the rest of the admin dashboard.

8. **Documentation:**
   - Document API endpoints, UI components, and usage instructions for future maintainers.

**Technologies:** Next.js/React, TypeScript, Radix UI or Material UI, Supabase/Postgres (with RLS), CSV export libraries (e.g., papaparse), and existing API infrastructure.

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify only admin users can access /admin/properties and all data is visible across developers.
2. Test property search and each filter (developer, status, price, location) for accuracy and performance with large datasets.
3. Confirm properties table displays correct data, supports sorting, pagination, and multi-row selection.
4. Execute bulk approve, reject, and delete actions; verify database updates, UI feedback, and error handling for partial failures.
5. Test CSV export with various filters and large result sets; ensure exported data matches visible table data.
6. Validate RLS policies prevent unauthorized access, even via direct API calls.
7. Check audit logs for all bulk actions.
8. Test accessibility (keyboard navigation, ARIA labels), responsive design, and loading/error/empty states.
9. Review documentation for completeness and clarity.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Page Structure, Access Control, and Properties Table [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the /admin/properties route with admin-only access, and build the main properties table with pagination, sorting, and multi-row selection.
### Details:
Use Next.js routing and existing authentication/role-based access control to restrict the page to admin users. Integrate a UI framework (Radix UI or Material UI) for responsive layout. Create a paginated, sortable table displaying Property ID, Developer, Status (with StatusBadge), Price, Location, and Actions. Support multi-row selection with checkboxes for bulk actions. Ensure loading, empty, and error states are handled.

## 2. Develop Property Search, Advanced Filters, and Bulk Actions [done]
### Dependencies: 64.1
### Description: Add cross-developer property search, advanced filtering (developer, status, price, location), and implement bulk approve, reject, and delete actions with confirmation dialogs.
### Details:
Integrate a debounced search bar and server-driven filters for developer (multi-select), status (enum), price range, and location. Connect filters to backend for scalability. Implement bulk action toolbar for approve, reject, and delete, using confirmation dialogs for destructive actions. Integrate with PATCH /api/properties/bulk and create new endpoints if needed. Provide optimistic UI updates and error handling.

## 3. Implement CSV Export, Performance, Security, and Documentation [done]
### Dependencies: 64.2
### Description: Enable CSV export of filtered property data, enforce server-side pagination and RLS, and document API endpoints and UI components.
### Details:
Add an export button to download filtered property data as CSV, ensuring all visible columns are included and large exports use streaming or background jobs. Enforce server-side pagination/filtering and strict RLS policies for security. Log all bulk actions. Document API endpoints, UI components, and usage instructions for maintainers.
