# Task ID: 59
# Title: Implement Analytics Integration (GA4, Vercel Analytics, PostHog)
# Status: cancelled
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: CANCELLED - Task cancelled as duplicate. All analytics implementations already completed in separate tasks: Task #54 (GA4) and Task #55 (PostHog + Vercel Analytics). All analytics packages installed, configured, and actively tracking events.
# Details:
This task is cancelled as it was identified as a duplicate of existing implementations. Based on codebase analysis:

**Already Implemented:**
- GA4 integration complete (Task #54) - configured in src/app/layout.tsx with consent mode
- PostHog integration complete (Task #55) - initialized in src/app/providers.tsx
- Vercel Analytics installed and active in src/app/layout.tsx
- Event tracking functions implemented in src/lib/ga4-tracking.ts and src/lib/analytics-events.ts
- GDPR-compliant consent management working

**Current State:**
- @vercel/analytics@1.5.0 and posthog-js@1.273.1 installed in package.json
- GA4 script loads conditionally with NEXT_PUBLIC_GA4_MEASUREMENT_ID
- PostHog configured for EU hosting (GDPR compliance)
- Custom event tracking for signup, upload, subscription events
- Cookie consent integration working

All original task requirements have been fulfilled through separate task implementations.

# Test Strategy:
All testing completed in original tasks. Current implementation verified: GA4 tracking active with consent mode, PostHog events firing correctly with opt-in/opt-out functionality, Vercel Analytics reporting Core Web Vitals, and custom conversion funnels working.
