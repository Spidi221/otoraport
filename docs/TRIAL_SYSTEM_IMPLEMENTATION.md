# 14-Day Trial System Implementation - Task #49

## Overview
Comprehensive implementation of a 14-day free trial system for OTO-RAPORT SaaS platform. Users can test all features for 14 days without providing a credit card, with automatic trial expiration and upgrade prompts.

## Implementation Summary

### Subtask 49.1: Database Schema and RLS Policies ✅
**File:** `supabase/migrations/20251008_add_trial_system.sql`

**Features:**
- Created `trial_status_enum` type: ('active', 'expired', 'converted', 'cancelled')
- Added `trial_status` column to developers table (default: 'active')
- Verified `trial_ends_at` column exists
- Created `set_trial_on_signup()` database function - automatically sets trial_ends_at = NOW() + 14 days
- Created trigger `trigger_set_trial_on_signup` on INSERT to developers table
- Created `check_trial_expiration()` function to check and update expired trials
- Added composite index `idx_developers_trial_status_ends_at` for performance
- Backfilled existing developers with appropriate trial_status
- RLS policies remain secure - trial users can access their own data

**Key Points:**
- Trial is set automatically on signup via database trigger
- No manual intervention required
- Idempotent migration (safe to run multiple times)

### Subtask 49.2: Trial Status Middleware ✅
**File:** `src/lib/middleware/trial-middleware.ts`

**Exported Functions:**
```typescript
// Check and auto-update trial status
checkTrialStatus(developerId: string): Promise<TrialStatusResult>

// Verify active trial or subscription
requireActiveTrial(developerId: string): Promise<{ hasAccess, reason, trialStatus }>

// Get trial status by user_id (for middleware)
getTrialStatusByUserId(userId: string): Promise<TrialStatusResult | null>

// Check feature access (ministry endpoints always allowed)
canAccessFeature(developerId: string, feature: 'upload' | 'properties' | 'ministry_endpoints' | 'analytics'): Promise<{ allowed, reason? }>

// Get user-friendly error message
getTrialErrorMessage(reason?: string): string
```

**Key Features:**
- Automatically updates trial_status to 'expired' when trial_ends_at < NOW()
- Ministry endpoints are ALWAYS accessible (compliance requirement)
- Returns detailed trial info (isActive, daysRemaining, status)
- Handles both trial and paid subscription access

### Subtask 49.3: Trial Expired Page ✅
**Files:**
- `src/app/trial-expired/page.tsx` - Trial expired landing page
- `src/app/api/user/trial-stats/route.ts` - API for trial statistics

**Features:**
- Professional conversion-focused design
- Shows trial accomplishments (properties count, projects, uploads, days used)
- Full PricingSection component integration
- Clear upgrade CTAs to Stripe checkout
- "Why continue?" benefits section
- Contact support link
- Polish language throughout

**User Experience:**
- Highlights what user achieved during trial
- Emphasizes data is safe and preserved
- Multiple upgrade paths (Basic, Pro, Enterprise)
- Professional, non-pushy design

### Subtask 49.4: Dashboard Trial Countdown Banner ✅
**File:** `src/components/dashboard/trial-banner.tsx`

**Features:**
- Color-coded based on days remaining:
  - Green: >7 days remaining
  - Yellow: 3-7 days remaining
  - Red: 1-2 days remaining (urgent)
- Shows days remaining and exact expiration date
- Prominent "Upgrade Now" CTA button
- Dismissible via localStorage (reappears after 24 hours)
- Only shows for users with trial_status='active' or subscription_status='trialing'
- Responsive design
- Polish language

**Integration:**
- Added to `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`
- Uses developer data from auth hook
- Automatically hidden for paid users

### Subtask 49.5: Signup Flow Integration ✅
**File:** `src/app/api/user/profile/route.ts` (updated)

**Changes:**
- New users get `subscription_status='trialing'` (not 'active')
- Database trigger automatically sets `trial_ends_at = NOW() + 14 days`
- Database trigger automatically sets `trial_status = 'active'`
- No credit card required during signup
- Seamless onboarding experience

### Subtask 49.6: Middleware and API Enforcement ✅
**Updated Files:**
- `src/middleware.ts` - Main application middleware
- `src/app/api/upload/route.ts` - File upload API
- `src/app/api/properties/route.ts` - Properties creation API

**Enforcement Rules:**
1. **Ministry endpoints** (`/api/public/*`) - ALWAYS accessible (even with expired trial)
2. **Trial expired page** (`/trial-expired`) - Always accessible
3. **Protected routes** - Check trial status:
   - If trial_status='expired' → redirect to `/trial-expired` (pages) or 403 (APIs)
   - If subscription invalid → redirect to dashboard with error or 403
4. **Upload API** - Blocks file uploads if trial expired
5. **Properties API** - Blocks property creation if trial expired

**Error Messages (Polish):**
- "Twój okres próbny wygasł. Upgrade aby kontynuować."
- "Twój 14-dniowy okres próbny wygasł. Upgrade do planu Basic, Pro lub Enterprise aby kontynuować."

### Subtask 49.7: Type Safety ✅
**File:** `src/types/database.ts` (updated)

**Changes:**
- Added `trial_status: 'active' | 'expired' | 'converted' | 'cancelled'` to Row, Insert, Update types
- Already had `trial_ends_at: string | null`
- Full TypeScript type safety maintained
- No breaking changes to existing code

## Testing Checklist

### Database Testing
- [ ] Run migration: `npx supabase migration up`
- [ ] Verify enum created: `SELECT enum_range(NULL::trial_status_enum);`
- [ ] Test trigger on INSERT: Create new developer, check trial_ends_at is set
- [ ] Test check_trial_expiration function manually
- [ ] Verify index exists: `\d developers`

### Signup Flow Testing
- [ ] New signup → verify trial_ends_at = signup_date + 14 days
- [ ] New signup → verify trial_status = 'active'
- [ ] New signup → verify subscription_status = 'trialing'
- [ ] Verify no card required during signup

### Trial Banner Testing
- [ ] Trial user (day 13) → banner shows green, correct days
- [ ] Trial user (day 5) → banner shows yellow
- [ ] Trial user (day 1) → banner shows red with urgency
- [ ] Paid user → banner hidden
- [ ] Dismiss banner → hidden for 24 hours
- [ ] After 24 hours → banner reappears

### Trial Expired Flow Testing
- [ ] Manually expire trial (set trial_ends_at to past)
- [ ] Access /dashboard → should redirect to /trial-expired
- [ ] /trial-expired page displays correctly with stats
- [ ] Pricing cards show on /trial-expired
- [ ] Upgrade button links work

### API Enforcement Testing
- [ ] Expired trial → POST /api/upload → 403 with message
- [ ] Expired trial → POST /api/properties → 403 with message
- [ ] Expired trial → GET /api/public/{clientId}/data.xml → 200 OK (allowed)
- [ ] Expired trial → GET /api/public/{clientId}/data.csv → 200 OK (allowed)
- [ ] Active trial → all APIs work normally

### Middleware Testing
- [ ] Expired trial + access protected page → redirect to /trial-expired
- [ ] Expired trial + access ministry endpoint → allowed (200 OK)
- [ ] Active trial → access all pages normally
- [ ] Paid user → no trial checks applied

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Trial expires during active session → next request catches it
- [ ] Trial status updates correctly (active → expired)
- [ ] Trial user upgrades → trial_status = 'converted'
- [ ] Ministry endpoints work for ANY trial status (critical!)
- [ ] Trial banner doesn't break with null values

## Security Considerations

✅ **Implemented:**
- RLS policies remain intact - trial users only access their own data
- Ministry endpoints ALWAYS accessible (compliance requirement)
- Trial status checked server-side (not client-side only)
- Auto-update of expired trials prevents stale state
- Database trigger ensures trial always set on signup

✅ **Best Practices:**
- No client-side trial bypass possible
- Trial checks in both middleware AND APIs (defense in depth)
- Graceful degradation if trial check fails (fail-open for monitoring)
- Clear error messages guide users to upgrade

## Ministry Compliance

✅ **Critical Requirement Met:**
- Ministry endpoints (`/api/public/*`) are ALWAYS accessible
- Even users with expired trials can access XML/CSV/MD5 endpoints
- This ensures compliance with Polish law regarding data publication
- Government can always access required data

## User Experience Flow

1. **Day 0 (Signup):**
   - User signs up → trial_ends_at = NOW() + 14 days
   - No credit card required
   - Full access to all features

2. **Days 1-7:**
   - Green trial banner shows: "Zostało X dni okresu próbnego"
   - User can dismiss banner (reappears next day)

3. **Days 8-11:**
   - Yellow trial banner (more prominent)
   - "Upgrade teraz" CTA

4. **Days 12-14:**
   - Red banner with urgency: "Upgrade teraz, aby nie stracić dostępu!"
   - Daily reminders

5. **Day 14+ (Expired):**
   - Access blocked to uploads and property creation
   - Redirected to `/trial-expired` page
   - Ministry endpoints still accessible
   - Clear upgrade path with accomplishments shown

6. **After Upgrade:**
   - trial_status → 'converted'
   - Full access restored
   - No trial checks applied

## Polish Language

All user-facing text is in Polish:
- ✅ Trial banner messages
- ✅ Trial expired page
- ✅ API error messages
- ✅ Upgrade CTAs
- ✅ Days remaining countdown
- ✅ Benefits and features

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy migration:** Run migration on production database
2. **Test manually:** Follow testing checklist above
3. **Monitor logs:** Watch for trial expiration events in production
4. **Analytics:** Track trial → paid conversion rates
5. **Email notifications:** (Future) Send email reminders at day 10, 12, 14
6. **Stripe integration:** Ensure payment flow sets trial_status='converted'

## Notes

- Migration is **idempotent** - safe to run multiple times
- Database trigger handles trial setup - no manual intervention needed
- Ministry compliance is preserved throughout
- User experience is conversion-focused but not pushy
- All checks are server-side for security
- TypeScript types updated for full type safety

## Support

For issues or questions:
- Check logs for `TRIAL CHECK:`, `TRIAL MIDDLEWARE:` messages
- Verify migration applied: `SELECT * FROM developers WHERE trial_status IS NOT NULL LIMIT 1;`
- Test trial expiration: Manually set trial_ends_at to past, try accessing protected routes
- Verify ministry endpoints always work regardless of trial status
